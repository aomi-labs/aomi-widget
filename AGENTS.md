# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

`src/` holds the publishable widget library: `components/assistant-ui/` for the Aomi frame and chat surfaces, `components/ui/` for shadcn-style primitives, `hooks/` for reusable state, `lib/` for runtime/context helpers, `utils/` for wallet helpers, and `themes/` for CSS token packs that feed the `styles.css` entry point. The demo Next.js app now lives in `apps/landing/` and consumes the built package from `dist/`; use it to validate UI flows before publishing. Static assets shared by the example go in `apps/landing/public/`, while high-level product briefs sit in `specs/`—update both when you introduce new flows.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `pnpm run dev` — Next dev server for the root workspace; handy for debugging shared configs.
- `pnpm run build:lib` — tsup build that emits ESM/CJS bundles and `*.d.ts` files under `dist/`.
- `pnpm --filter landing dev` — launches the demo at http://localhost:3000 using the last built library.
- `pnpm run dev:landing:live` — watches `src/` with tsup while running the landing so library updates hot-reload into the demo.
- `pnpm run lint` — ESLint (with Next + TypeScript rules) across the library and example.
- `pnpm run prettier:fix` — Prettier with the Tailwind plugin; keeps class orders deterministic before committing.
- `pnpm run generate:theme -- --name=neon` — scaffolds a new CSS token file under `src/themes/` using the default theme as a starting point; remember to update `src/themes/tokens.config.ts`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

The codebase is TypeScript + React 19 on Next 15. Prefer functional components with explicit prop interfaces exported near the component. Follow Prettier defaults (2-space indent, double quotes, trailing commas) and rely on `clsx` + `class-variance-authority` for styling variants. Components use PascalCase file names (e.g., `AomiFrame.tsx`), hooks start with `use` (e.g., `hooks/useWallet.ts`), and shared contexts sit in `lib/`. Tailwind utility strings should group layout → color → motion classes to minimize churn.

## Testing Guidelines

There is no dedicated automated test suite yet, so treat `pnpm run build:lib` and `pnpm run lint` as the minimum regression gates. Validate UI behavior through the `apps/landing/` app before opening a PR, and capture regressions with story-specific checks or lightweight React Testing Library specs (`*.test.tsx`) colocated with the component whenever you add new logic branches.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Commits follow short, imperative summaries (`Fix linting ci`, `Update packages for …`). Keep bodies optional but include rationale when touching build or security-sensitive files. For pull requests, add: 1) a concise description of the change and linked issue, 2) a checklist of commands you ran (lint, build, demo), and 3) screenshots or short clips for UI-impacting work. Make sure the PR mentions any `specs/` updates so reviewers can cross-check behavior changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Never commit `.env` contents. Local development requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` (see README) so be sure to supply mock-safe values when recording demos. Wallet helpers in `utils/wallet.ts` assume checksummed addresses; validate inputs before invoking them, and funnel all network or key-related secrets through the backend instead of embedding them in this repo.
