  //    lazily, so it sat over the composer for the whole of DS6 turn 1.
  //    Pre-seeding the same key the hook reads means it never renders.
  //    "declined" (not "accepted") — the recorder should not opt a browser
  //    into analytics to get a clean frame.
  // 2. Next's dev-tools indicator renders a red "N Issues" pill bottom-left.
  //    On a product demo it reads as "this app has 3 errors".
  // 3. The thread sidebar is collapsed by clicking its trigger after load —
  //    the portal never mounts shadcn's SidebarProvider, so the usual
  //    `sidebar_state` cookie is not read and has to be a real click. Worth
  //    doing: prior debug threads are on camera otherwise, one of them
