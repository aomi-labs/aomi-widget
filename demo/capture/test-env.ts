 * 2026-08-02: proxy 10 ETH (seeded), sim 10,000 ETH (boot snapshot).

 * same fork url re-forks them against the CURRENT (post-seed) proxy
 * state. Runs after every seeding pass; a sim that has vanished is
 * skipped (the backend will respawn it on its own terms).
 *
 * CRITICAL caveat, measured 2026-08-02: `anvil_reset` re-applies anvil's
 * OWN genesis prefund — the 10 mnemonic dev accounts read 10,000 ETH on
 * the sim regardless of what the proxy holds, because local account
 * state shadows forked state. ERC-20 balances fork through fine (no
 * prefund shadows them); NATIVE balances of dev accounts do not. So this
 * returns the sim endpoints as `ForkedChain`s and the CALLER must
 * re-apply the demo wallet's native balances (and code wipe) to each sim
 * mirror, exactly as it did to the proxy. Skipping that re-application
 * is how an agent came to stake 5,000 ETH of a 10 ETH wallet.
