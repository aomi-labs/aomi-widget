/**
 * The showpiece: one sentence, two protocols, a position that didn't exist
 * before.
 *
 * Stake ETH with Lido, then put the staked position to work as collateral on
 * Aave and borrow against it. A human doing this has four browser tabs open and
 * needs to know a piece of trivia: Aave v3 does not accept rebasing stETH, it
 * accepts **wstETH**, so there is a wrap step in the middle that nobody asks
 * for and everybody needs.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT mention wrapping in the prompt. Asking for the outcome
 * and letting the agent discover the intermediate step is the entire demo — if
 * it names wstETH on its own, that is the moment a DeFi-literate viewer sits
 * up. If it doesn't, we have learned something real about the product and the
 * take fails honestly rather than being scripted around.
