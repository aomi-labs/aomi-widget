/**
 * The scenario that motivated the whole studio.
 *
 * This exact prompt was demoed against an unfunded wallet on real mainnet. The
 * agent did ten steps of correct work and concluded "your ETH balance is 0 ETH"
 * — right answer, useless demo. The reasoning was never the problem; the
 * environment was. Recording it on a funded fork is both a good demo and the
 * proof that the studio fixed the actual failure.
 *
 * Rides on stories DS2 / DS3 / P1 (Lido, Rocket Pool, Ether.fi), which run in
 * product-mono's daily smoke lane, so the underlying path is already exercised.
