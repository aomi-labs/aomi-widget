/**
 * Scenario 10: instant unstake — DS6 played backwards, and the trust take.
 *
 * Every staking demo on the internet shows money going IN. Nobody shows the
 * exit, because for most products the exit is where the story gets awkward
 * (cooldowns, tickets, "come back in 3 days"). Marinade's liquid_unstake is
 * instant at the cost of a pool fee — which hands the agent a genuinely
 * agent-shaped decision to narrate on camera: pay the fee for liquidity now,
 * or order a delayed unstake for free. The prompt forces the "now" branch;
 * the agent explaining WHY (fee vs. wait, with the simulated fee as a real
 * number) is the money shot.
 *
 * Fixture note: this wallet is seeded WITH mSOL, unlike DS6 which must start
 * without it. That is not the DS6 workaround sneaking back — it is the
 * premise. A returning staker holds mSOL by definition, and 3.5 mSOL matches
 * what DS6's stake actually minted, so the two takes cut together as one
 * story ("staked last week, needed cash this week").
 *
 * Skill surface: `liquid_unstake` is allowlisted in the marinade manifest
 * (deposit / liquid_unstake / order_unstake / claim), wallet-side accounts
 * are get_msol_from / authority / transfer_sol_to — all the E2E wallet. The
 * mSOL ATA exists (we seed it), so unlike DS6 there is no account-creation
 * side quest: this should be the cleanest execution take on the SVM roster.
