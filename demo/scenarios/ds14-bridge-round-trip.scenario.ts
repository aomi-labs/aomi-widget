/**
 * The bridge demo's encore: go to Base AND come back, in one conversation.
 *
 * ds4 proved a one-way bridge completes on forks. This take proves the
 * machinery is symmetric: the actors watch every configured SpokePool, so
 * a Base→mainnet deposit gets filled exactly like mainnet→Base. On camera
 * that reads as "the agent moves my money wherever, whenever" — which is
 * the actual product claim — and mechanically it exercises the E2E
 * executor on a second chain (Base-side deposit) for the first time.
 *
 * The return leg is phrased as a decision ("half of what landed") so the
 * agent has to read the REAL arrived amount off Base first — it can't
 * pattern-match the number from turn 1.
 *
 * Both actors armed: the agent may pick Across or canonical for either
 * leg. Note a canonical Base→mainnet withdrawal has a 7-day challenge
 * window in reality — a correct agent should choose Across for the
 * return leg and ideally SAY why; if it proposes the canonical
 * withdrawal, the take still executes (OpDepositFinalizer only covers
 * L1→L2, so the return would stall) and the block gate fails it — an
 * honest outcome worth keeping.
