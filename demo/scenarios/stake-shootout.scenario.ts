/**
 * Staking, but make it an argument.
 *
 * DS2 asks for "the highest yield pool" and the agent picks Lido. This one
 * forces a defended comparison across liquid staking *and* restaking — where
 * the honest answer involves risk that a naive yield ranking hides (restaking
 * pays more because it carries slashing exposure the vanilla product doesn't).
 *
 * The demo value is not the transaction. It is watching the agent decline to
 * just chase the biggest APR number, then act on its own reasoning. An agent
 * that says "the highest yield here is not the one I'd pick, and here's why"
 * is a fundamentally different product from a yield sorter.
