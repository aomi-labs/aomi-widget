/**
 * Lending as a *credit* primitive, not a savings account.
 *
 * Supplying to Aave alone is a one-liner and reads as "deposit money, earn
 * yield" — table stakes. Borrowing against it is three transactions (approve,
 * supply, borrow), requires the agent to reason about collateral factors and
 * health, and produces a leveraged position. That is the version a fintech
 * partner recognises as real balance-sheet mechanics.
 *
 * Phrased as an intent with a constraint ("stay conservative"), not a
 * procedure — the interesting question is whether the agent picks a sane LTV
 * on its own rather than borrowing to the limit.
