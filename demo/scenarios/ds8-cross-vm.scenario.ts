/**
 * Scenario 8: Ethereum and Solana in ONE thread — the differentiator take.
 *
 * DS2 proves the agent works on EVM. DS6 proves it works on Solana. Neither
 * proves the thing that is actually hard to copy: the same agent, the same
 * conversation, the same wallet chip, crossing virtual machines mid-thread
 * with no mode switch and no second product. Most agentic wallets are EVM-only;
 * the ones that aren't tend to be two apps wearing one logo.
 *
 * This is the one to show a partner who already believes we can do EVM.
 *
 * Requires BOTH environments up at once — anvil fork (chain 1) and the
 * Surfpool mirror — and an E2E wallet seeded with both addresses, which
 * `seedUrl` does automatically when a scenario declares `chains` and `svm`.
 * Both verifications run: EVM block-delta (anvil only mines on transactions)
 * AND the SVM balance assertions.
 *
 * STATUS: authored, not yet recorded. The two single-VM legs are proven
 * independently; what is unproven here is the two of them in one thread —
 * specifically whether the agent keeps both wallet identities straight across
 * a VM switch. That is exactly the risk worth finding out about, and it is
 * cheap to find out: both environments are forks.
