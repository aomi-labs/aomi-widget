/**
 * Scenario 12: comparison-shop the swap — two venues quoted on camera,
 * best one executed.
 *
 * DS6 already proves "agent swaps on Solana". What it does NOT show is why
 * routing through an agent beats opening Jupiter yourself: the agent can
 * quote MULTIPLE venues, show its work, and route to the winner. The skill
 * roster has both halves — `jupiter_prepare_swap` (quote+build in one call)
 * and `raydium_get_quote` / `raydium_build_swap` (quote and build split) —
 * so a head-to-head is native, no new capability required.
 *
 * The prompt explicitly names both venues. Left to itself the agent would
 * reasonably just use Jupiter (it IS an aggregator — meta-routing is its
 * job); naming Raydium forces the on-camera comparison, and honestly, an
 * aggregator's route vs. a single AMM's pool is a fair fight Jupiter usually
 * wins — the agent SAYING so, with both numbers visible, is the shot.
 *
 * Trace-driven take: the working trace will show two quote steps with two
 * USDC amounts side by side before anything stages. Whoever cuts the video
 * should freeze there — that frame is the thesis.
 *
 * CONFIDENCE: medium-high. Jupiter execution is take-proven; Raydium is
 * quote-only here in the happy path (the losing quote never executes), so
 * the unproven surface only matters if Raydium wins the quote — and both
 * venues share DS6's fresh-fork requirement. RE-FORK BEFORE SHOOTING.
