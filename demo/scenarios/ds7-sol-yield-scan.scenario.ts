/**
 * Scenario 7: the research turn, on Solana — read-only on purpose.
 *
 * This is the answer to the demo that started this whole effort: "stake half
 * my ETH in the highest yield pool" produced ten steps of correct reasoning
 * and then died on execution. The reasoning was never the weak part. So this
 * scenario ships the reasoning ALONE, where nothing can fail: no staging, no
 * approval, no broadcast, no wallet.
 *
 * Why it earns its place next to DS6 rather than being a lesser version of it:
 *
 * - It is the most reliable asset in the catalog. Execution takes are subject
 *   to LLM variance in bundle construction (DS6 lost three takes in a row to
 *   a repair loop); a read turn has no bundle to get wrong.
 * - Comparing venues is the thing a human cannot do quickly and an agent can.
 *   For a partner evaluating "what does this actually add", the scan IS the
 *   pitch — execution is table stakes once the answer is known.
 * - It cuts short. 20 seconds of an agent naming real venues with real rates
 *   is a social clip; a full execution take is not.
 *
 * `expectsExecution: false` is load-bearing: the recorder skips its
 * chain-movement proof, and no balance may move. If a take here ever spends
 * anything, that is a bug in the agent, not a better video.
