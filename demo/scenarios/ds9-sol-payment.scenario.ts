/**
 * Scenario 9: pay an invoice in USDC — the most relatable take in the catalog.
 *
 * Everything else we shoot is DeFi; this is money. "Send 150 USDC to this
 * address" is the one prompt a non-crypto partner maps onto their own product
 * instantly (payouts, invoices, remittance), and it exercises the unglamorous
 * plumbing that real payment flows die on:
 *
 * - The RECIPIENT has no USDC token account. A fresh address never does. The
 *   agent has to notice (`AccountNotFound` in simulation, per the global SVM
 *   debug rules) and stage the recipient's ATA creation before the transfer —
 *   the payer funds the rent, which is exactly how real Solana payments work
 *   and exactly the step naive integrations forget.
 * - Exact amounts. A swap take has price tolerance; a payment take does not.
 *   150 means 150.000000, and the verify bounds below are tight enough to
 *   catch a unit slip (USDC is 6 decimals — the classic "sent 150 million"
 *   bug is a 1e6 mistake).
 *
 * The recipient is a deterministic throwaway derived from the fixed seed
 * sha256("aomi-demo-studio-recipient-1") — a real on-curve pubkey that exists
 * nowhere outside this studio, so the fork's view of it is always "brand new
 * wallet". Nobody holds its private key on purpose: money sent there is
 * PROVABLY parked, which is the right property for a demo asset.
 *
 * Verify limitation, stated honestly: the studio's balance assertions read
 * the E2E wallet only, so the on-camera proof is the SENDER's side (USDC
 * 200 → 50, small SOL rent+fee dent). The recipient-side check (150 landed,
 * ATA exists) is one curl in the runbook, not yet a scenario assertion —
 * extend `svm.verify` with an `owner` override if this scenario earns
 * repeat use.
