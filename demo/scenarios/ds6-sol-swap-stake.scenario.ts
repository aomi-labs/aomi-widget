/**
 * Scenario 6: one agent, two virtual machines — the Solana leg.
 *
 * Runs entirely on the Surfpool mainnet-fork mirror; phase 0 proved both legs
 * execute there (Jupiter swap finalized, Marinade stake confirmed — see
 * specs/SOLANA-DEMO-PLAN.md "Phase 0 VERDICT"). Not a one-take real-money
 * proof video after all: as re-recordable as DS2.
 *
 * Environment contract:
 * - mirror up: `test-env svm up --cluster mainnet-beta`, with the operator
 *   providers.toml `[surfpool.mainnet-beta]` airdropping the demo wallet
 *   10 SOL and fabricating 25 USDC (fixtures re-apply on reset)
 * - the wallet's Marinade authorization done once via the bind/client_auto
 *   ceremonies (demo/capture/authorize-svm.mts)

      // Leaving the fixture out is the honest version of this demo: a

  // in one sentence ("Swap 5 SOL for USDC, then stake the rest") invites the
  // agent to stage them as a single batch — and the stake cannot simulate
  // against a SOL balance the swap has not freed yet, so the batch fails and
  // the agent loops trying to repair it.
  //
  // Splitting the legs removes the joint simulation entirely. It also reads
  // better on camera: a conversation rather than a command.
  //
  // Two smaller lessons baked into the wording:
  // - A single-prompt version (no approval turns) hangs differently — the
  //   agent parks on "⏳ waiting for wallet approval" until the timeout.
  // - Approvals must be worded AS approvals. "Go ahead and execute both"
  //   reads as an instruction to redo the swap, and the agent re-stages a leg
  //   that has already spent the balance.
