/**
 * The lending mirror of stake-shootout: make the agent COMPARE money
 * markets and commit to the winner.
 *
 * "Cheapest" is deliberately underspecified — a real borrower means
 * borrow APY, but a good agent should also weigh collateral LTV and
 * liquidation risk when it presents the choice. Aave v3 and Compound v3
 * both have first-class skills, so the comparison is a fair fight the
 * agent can actually referee: read both markets' live rates off the
 * fork, show its math, then open the position with the winner.
 *
 * Turn 2 approves whatever it proposed; the third turn makes it read the
 * opened position back off the chain — health factor and borrow rate as
 * on-chain facts, not claims.
