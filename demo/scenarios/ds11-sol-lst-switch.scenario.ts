/**
 * Scenario 11: switch liquid-staking providers in one sentence — the
 * "agent as stake manager" take, and DS7's execution sequel.
 *
 * DS7 ends with the agent comparing LST yields and naming a winner. This
 * scenario is the obvious next line in that conversation: "fine — move me."
 * mSOL → JitoSOL through Sanctum's LST router is a single swap, no
 * unstake-wait-restake loop, which is precisely the point: repositioning a
 * stake used to be a three-day project and is now one approved transaction.
 * Cut DS7 + DS11 together and you get research → decision → execution as one
 * continuous story, which is the whole product pitch in ~60 seconds.
 *
 * Skill surface: `sanctum` is an injected-tool skill (`sanctum_execute_swap`)
 * — Lane 2, the venue builds the transaction blob. That carries the same
 * fork-staleness risk DS6 taught us about with Jupiter: the venue quotes
 * against LIVE mainnet, the mirror is a snapshot, and the gap becomes
 * simulation failures as the snapshot ages. RE-FORK BEFORE SHOOTING THIS —
 * it is the standing runbook rule, and this scenario is why the rule exists.
 *
 * CONFIDENCE: draft. Jupiter and Marinade are take-proven; Sanctum has not
 * been through a phase-0 spike on the mirror. First recording doubles as
 * that spike — if `sanctum_execute_swap` won't replay on Surfpool, the
 * fallback is the same repositioning story via Jupiter (mSOL→JitoSOL routes
 * exist there too), which loses the Sanctum name-drop but keeps the take.
