/**
 * Cross-chain intent, end to end — the scenario the mock relayer was built
 * for (specs/MOCK-RELAYER.md).
 *
 * Both legs are forked (mainnet + Base) and the `across` chain actor plays
 * the relayer nobody else is running: it watches the mainnet fork's
 * SpokePool for the deposit and lands the REAL `fillRelay` on the Base
 * fork's REAL SpokePool, ~4s later. So the take shows a bridge that
 * actually completes — deposit on one chain, arrival on the other — with
 * zero real capital. An earlier version of this scenario pinned the
 * canonical bridge and could only ever show the deposit leg ("half true");
 * that constraint is gone, and the agent is free to pick Across, which is
 * what it prefers on real mainnet anyway.
 *
 * Made harder than "bridge some ETH": the agent has to decide how much to
 * keep back for gas rather than being handed an amount. And the third turn
 * makes the agent CHECK the destination — on camera, against the Base fork
 * — so the arrival is the agent's own report, not a caption.
 *
 * The recorder funds ONLY mainnet (source leg) and wipes the wallet's
 * EIP-7702 sweeper code on both forks first — without that wipe the fill's
 * ETH is stolen in-transaction by the delegate the fork inherits from the
 * real chain (see wipeAccountCode in capture/test-env.ts).
