Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'view' does not exist in type 'URL'.ts(2353)

The user is getting a TypeScript error in the `wallet-footer.tsx` file. The error says:

"Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'view' does not exist in type 'URL'.ts(2353)"

This is happening on lines 32 and 34 where they're calling `open({ view: "Account" })` and `open({ view: "Connect" })`.

It seems like the `open` function is being imported from somewhere and TypeScript thinks it expects a `URL` type, but they're passing an object with a `view` property.

Let me read the wallet-footer.tsx file to understand the context better.</details></think>

I need to see the full context of the `wallet-footer.tsx` file to understand what the `open` function is and where it's coming from.

I can see the issue now. Looking at the code:

1. Line 18 has the `open` function commented out: `// const { open } = useAppKit();`
2. Lines 32 and 34 are trying to use `open`, but it's not defined/imported since it's commented out
3. TypeScript is likely inferring that `open` refers to the global `window.open` function (which expects a URL string), hence the error about `URL` type

The fix is to uncomment line 18 to get the `open` function from `useAppKit()`. This will provide the correct `open` function that accepts an object with a `view` property.</details></think>

I can see the issue! The `open` function from `useAppKit()` is commented out on line 18, but you're trying to use it on lines 32 and 34. Since `open` isn't defined, TypeScript is likely falling back to the global `window.open` function (which expects a URL string), causing the type error.

Let me uncomment the `useAppKit` hook to fix this:

Good! I've uncommented the line that imports the `open` function from `useAppKit()`. This should fix the TypeScript error because now `open` will have the correct type that accepts an object with a `view` property (either "Account" or "Connect").

Let me check if there are any linter errors now.</details></think>

Now let me check if there are any remaining linter errors:

Perfect! The TypeScript error is now resolved. The issue was that the `open` function from `useAppKit()` was commented out, so TypeScript was interpreting `open` as the global `window.open` function which expects a URL string. Now that we've uncommented the import, the `open` function has the correct type that accepts an object with a `view` property.</details></think>

Perfect! The TypeScript error is now fixed. The issue was that the `open` function from `useAppKit()` was commented out on line 18. Without it being imported, TypeScript was treating `open` as the global `window.open` function (which expects a URL string), causing the type error.

By uncommenting `const { open } = useAppKit();`, the `open` function now has the correct type that accepts an object with a `view` property like `{ view: "Account" }` or `{ view: "Connect" }`.
