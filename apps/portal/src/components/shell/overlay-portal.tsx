/**
 * Renders full-page overlays (settings, packages) at `<body>` while keeping
 * their React tree where they are mounted.
 *
 * Both matter. The DOM escape lets one backdrop cover the sidebar and the chat
 * as a single surface, which is why these overlays used to be siblings of
 * `AomiFrame.Root`. But `AomiFrame.Root` is what mounts the Aomi runtime, so
 * a sibling sees `useOptionalAomiRuntime() === null` and cannot read the live
 * thread — that is how "Open a chat thread before enabling automatic signing."
 * came to fire with a chat open. A portal keeps the context and moves only the
 * DOM, so the overlays can live inside the frame.
