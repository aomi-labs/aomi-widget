/**
 * Per-IP rate limit for the *unauthenticated* widget-auth endpoints
 * (`exchange`, `siwe|siws nonce/verify`). These run before any bearer exists,
 * yet each one writes a `ba_verifications` row and does signature crypto / JWKS
 * fetches — and `exchange` can create a canonical user — so an unthrottled
 * caller can spam rows and burn CPU. We reuse the shared in-process
 * `checkRateLimit` helper/pattern (the same one the launch BFF routes use) so
 * there is one rate-limit implementation, keyed per client IP.
 *
 * Returned as a plain 429 `Response`; callers return it from inside the
 * `widgetRoute` handler so the wrapper still applies the cross-origin CORS
 * headers. A rate-limited response carries no `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
 * and preserves `Vary: Origin`, exactly like every other widget response.
