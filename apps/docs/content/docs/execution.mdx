# Execution

Execution flows keep the user in control while the assistant guides the steps.

## Flow

1. User describes an intent in chat.
2. Assistant proposes actions and gathers confirmations.
3. Wallet prompts appear via AppKit; signed payloads return to your backend to finalize.

## Safeguards

Validate every step server-side, enforce chain allowlists, and surface clear status messages in the UI.
