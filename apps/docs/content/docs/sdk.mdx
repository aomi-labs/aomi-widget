# SDK

Use the SDK to wrap fetch calls, handle streaming, and normalize errors.

## Capabilities

- Start and resume conversations with typed helpers.
- Listen to server-sent events for streaming responses.
- Retry idempotent calls when networks are flaky.

## Integration notes

Keep SDK instances close to your data-fetching layer so components stay presentation-focused.
