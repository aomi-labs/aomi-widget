# API Overview

Use the backend API to orchestrate chat, tools, and wallet actions from the widget.
- Chat endpoints stream assistant replies and tool invocations.
- Tool routes trigger wallet-aware actions with your server-side safety checks.
- Health and metadata endpoints expose capability flags for the client.

## Versioning

Keep the widget and backend in lockstep; breaking changes should be gated by an explicit `version` parameter or header.

## Authentication

Protect every endpoint behind your usual auth (cookies, tokens, or signed payloads). The widget should only send public state; secrets stay on the server.
