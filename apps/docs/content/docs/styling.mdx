# Styling

Apply your brand without rewiring the component tree.

## Tokens

Update `src/themes` tokens and import `@aomi-labs/react/styles.css` to apply them across the docs and demos. The shadcn token system is supported out of the box.

## Utilities

Use Tailwind utilities for layout and spacing; reserve custom CSS variables for colors and typography. See the shadcn docs for additional patterns.
