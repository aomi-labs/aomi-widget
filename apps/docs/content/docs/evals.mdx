# Evals

Build small evaluation suites to keep regressions out of production.

## What to cover

- Prompt changes that affect core intents (portfolio, transfers).
- Tool argument validation, especially around amounts and destinations.
- Wallet edge cases like network mismatches and rejected signatures.

## Running checks

Use lightweight scripts or Playwright snippets to replay conversations against staging before deploying.
