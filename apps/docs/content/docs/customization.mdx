# Customization

Adjust copy, behaviors, and visible surfaces without forking the library.

## Runtime options

- Toggle thread list visibility, message limits, and attachment support through component props.
- Provide a `config` object to control assistant ids, backend URLs, and wallet requirements.

## Product fit

Use feature flags to roll out new experiences gradually and collect feedback before enabling them for all users.
