# Components

The widget ships composable pieces you can mix and match.

## Core exports

- `AomiFrame` — full assistant shell with chat surface and thread list.
- `AomiChat` — chat-only experience when you want to control layout yourself.
- UI primitives — buttons, cards, badges, and form controls reused across docs and demos.

## Usage

Import components from `@aomi-labs/react`, wrap your app with the provided providers, and include `@aomi-labs/react/styles.css` for tokens.
