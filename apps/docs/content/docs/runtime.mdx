# Runtime

Configure the runtime so the widget can talk to your backend and wallets reliably.

## Environment

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` for the frontend. Keep private keys or RPC URLs on the server.

## State

Persist conversations on the server when you need continuity; otherwise, scope them per session to reduce storage.
