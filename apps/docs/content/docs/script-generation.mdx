# Script Generation

Let the assistant draft scripts while keeping execution behind server checks.

## Flow

- Collect user intent and context in chat.
- Generate scripts or transaction payloads server-side.
- Return previews to the client; require explicit confirmation before running anything on-chain.

## Tips

Log generated scripts for auditability and attach trace ids to conversation updates.
