# CLI

Use the CLI to bootstrap new integrations, run checks, and inspect local configs.

## Common tasks

- `pnpm dlx aomi-cli init` to scaffold a project.
- `pnpm dlx aomi-cli doctor` to verify environment variables and wallet providers.
- `pnpm dlx aomi-cli lint` to surface config mistakes early.

## Tips

Run CLI commands from the workspace root so shared configs (tsconfig, eslint) are discovered automatically.
