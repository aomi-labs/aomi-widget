# Architecture

Aomi Widget couples a React shell with a backend that handles AI orchestration and wallet safety.

## Layers

- **UI shell** — `@aomi-labs/react` renders chat, thread list, and wallet footer.
- **Backend** — runs the assistant, routes tool calls, and enforces policy.
- **Wallets** — connected via Reown AppKit; transactions never leave the user's control.

## Data flow

User input flows to your backend, which streams assistant tokens and tool calls back through SSE. Wallet prompts stay client-side, but signed payloads are sent to your backend for execution.
