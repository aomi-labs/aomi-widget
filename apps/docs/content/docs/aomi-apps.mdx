# Aomi Apps

Aomi Apps bundle curated task flows on top of the widget runtime so teams can ship guided experiences fast.
- Use them when you want opinionated flows (portfolio views, execution checklists) without building UI from scratch.
- They reuse the same backend policies and wallet wiring that power your embedded widget.

## Connecting an app

1. Start your backend with the assistant endpoints available.
2. Provide `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` so the docs site can talk to your services locally.
3. Run `pnpm --filter @aomi-labs/widget-docs dev` and walk through the flow before shipping.

## Custom notes

- Apps inherit the theme tokens defined for the widget and respect your CSS variables.
- Fork an app page if you need to tweak copy, steps, or guardrails for a specific customer.
