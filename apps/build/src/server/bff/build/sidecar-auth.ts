 * Sidecar auth rides the official service-bearer path (the same
 * PORTAL_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY + committed-topology signing that backend
 * bearers use — packages/account): the BFF mints a short-lived EdDSA JWT per
 * proxied request, and the in-VM sidecar verifies it against aomi-bff's
 * committed *public* key, which is safe to ship into a sandbox that runs
 * agent-generated code. No shared secret is stored anywhere — not in the
 * registry, not in the VM env.
 *
 * The audience is "aomi-sidecar", never "aomi-backend", so a bearer that
 * leaks out of the VM is useless against the backend (its verifier rejects
 * the audience); `sub` pins the bearer to one run id, which the sidecar
 * checks against its own AOMI_SIDECAR_RUN_ID.
