# API Endpoints

This section tracks the HTTP surface exposed by your backend. Map each route to your own controllers when integrating.

## Core routes

- `POST /api/chat` — start or continue a conversation, streaming assistant messages.
- `POST /api/tools` — invoke server-side tools that may call wallets or third-party APIs.
- `GET /api/health` — lightweight readiness probe for deployments and local dev.

## Payload shape

Keep payloads small and explicit: include the conversation id, user id, and any tool arguments. Avoid sending private keys or secrets from the browser.
