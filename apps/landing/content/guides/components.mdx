# Component Library

UI components are distributed via our [shadcn registry](/docs/shadcn). Install them with a single command:

```bash
npx shadcn add https://widget.aomi.dev/r/aomi-frame.json
```

<WidgetDemo />

## Component Reference

- [UI Primitives](/docs/components/ui-components) - Buttons, dialogs, cards, and other building blocks
- [Aomi Components](/docs/components/aomi-components) - Assistant-specific components like `aomi-frame`

## Usage

After installation, components are copied directly into your project at the location specified in your `components.json` configuration. You can then import and use them:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { AomiFrame } from "@/components/aomi-frame";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
      <AomiFrame height="600px" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Customization

Since components are copied to your project, you have full control to customize them. Edit the component files directly to match your design system.

See [Theming & Visual Styling](/docs/theming) for theming options.
