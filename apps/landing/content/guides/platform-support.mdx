# Platform Support

The widget targets modern browsers and React 19.

## Frameworks

- Next.js 15 (app router) is the primary target.
- Other React setups work if they support Server Components and streaming.

## Wallets

Reown AppKit handles wallet connections across chains; ensure chains are configured server-side before exposing them to users.
