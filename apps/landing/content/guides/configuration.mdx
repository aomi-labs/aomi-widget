# Runtime Configuration

Adjust behavior, runtime options, and component props without forking the library.

## Runtime options

- Toggle thread list visibility, message limits, and attachment support through component props.
- Provide a `config` object to control assistant ids, backend URLs, and wallet requirements.

## Drop in your own component (shadcn style)

```tsx
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { AomiFrame } from "@aomi-labs/react";

export function CustomShell() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardContent className="p-0">
        <AomiFrame config={{ backendUrl: "/api/chat" }} />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Product fit

Use feature flags to roll out new experiences gradually and collect feedback before enabling them for all users.
