# Integration Examples

- Fork a crypto app frontend (DEX, wallet dashboard, analytics) and mount the widget sidebar for chat + actions.
- Use the shadcn presets to scaffold the assistant frame, then wire your RPC/session config.
- Treat the widget as a drop-in React component; import from `@aomi-labs/react` and include `@aomi-labs/react/styles.css`.
