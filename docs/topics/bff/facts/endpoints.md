# BFF Endpoints

The portal BFF routes live under `apps/portal/src/app/api`. They translate browser-facing portal calls into backend requests.

## Endpoint Table

| FE BFF endpoint                    | Who calls it                                | Where it gets to, if any                                                                                                             | What it does                                                                                                                                                       | Code path                                                 |

| `POST /api/bff/launch/preflight`   | Launch deploy preview step                  | Rust backend `POST /api/platforms/:platform/projects` when a repo stands in for a project, then `POST /api/platforms/:platform/deploy` with `preflight: true` | Creates/resolves the project (creation is the only step that takes a platform), then previews the deploy and returns the immutable source commit.                  | `apps/portal/src/app/api/bff/launch/preflight/route.ts`   |
| `POST /api/bff/launch/deploy`      | Launch deploy step                          | Rust backend `POST /api/platforms/:platform/deploy` with `preflight: false`                                                          | Applies a deploy for an owned `projectId`, pinned to the exact preflight commit. The platform is derived from the project's binding, never from the caller.        | `apps/portal/src/app/api/bff/launch/deploy/route.ts`      |
| `GET /api/bff/launch/status`       | Launch status polling                       | Rust backend `GET /api/platforms/:platform/deployments/:deployment/status`                                                           | Polls deployment status; the backend resolves CI per poll.                                                                                                         | `apps/portal/src/app/api/bff/launch/status/route.ts`      |

| `POST /api/bff/launch/redeploy`    | Project page redeploy action                | Rust backend `GET /api/integrations/github-app/user/projects/:id/latest-deployment`, then backend deployment rerun                    | Proves ownership, hydrates the project's backend-owned CI run, and asks the backend to rerun it. Returns `409` when no run is available.                            | `apps/portal/src/app/api/bff/launch/redeploy/route.ts`    |

## Operational Notes

- `/api/bff/launch/*` is the current portal launch flow and uses `apps/portal/src/server/bff/launch/routes.ts` for backend authorization and request helpers.
- There is no `/sources` route family and no `app_source_id`: the persisted identity is the Project (`projectId`), and project-scoped reads never accept a caller platform — the backend derives each project's bound platform. See `docs/topics/deploy/facts/projects.md`.
- Onboarding backend calls use the portal's service identity: `aomi-bff` mints a short-lived `service` bearer with `PORTAL_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY`. The committed service-topology TOML is selected automatically from the backend target / Vercel environment.
- The portal onboarding BFF does not use `AOMI_ADMIN_SECRET` or `APP_DEPLOY_ACTIVATION_TOKEN`. Activation tokens remain the CLI/update-path credential, not the browser onboarding credential.
- Launch defaults are env-driven server-side config: `APP_DEPLOY_PLATFORMS` (default `community`, JSON array or comma-separated), `APP_DEPLOY_AOMI_TOML_PATHS` (default `aomi.toml`, comma-separated), and optional `APP_DEPLOY_TARGET_TAGS` (comma-separated); the first configured platform is the primary deploy target, while app pickers may merge every configured platform. Aomi Build does not expose those names as a directory. Its switcher sends one exact platform name through the signed-in user's source read; the manager returns `404` for an unknown name, and the browser changes context only after a successful response. Existing-repository connection signs the exact platform, `owner/repo`, and an allowlisted Build Projects return URL into GitHub OAuth state; the callback proves repo access, claims the source, and returns success or an actionable error to the scoped Projects page. The deploy source ref is an immutable commit SHA from `APP_DEPLOY_SOURCE_REF` (or `APP_DEPLOY_SOURCE_COMMIT`).
- Chat links use `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_URL`, defaulting to `https://chat.aomi.dev`.
- Redeploy requires a portal-side `GITHUB_TOKEN` because it calls GitHub's workflow-run rerun endpoint directly.
- Backend-owned Privy auth uses the non-API page route `/auth/privy`; the browser callback posts to the backend callback URL returned by `POST /api/auth/privy/begin`.
