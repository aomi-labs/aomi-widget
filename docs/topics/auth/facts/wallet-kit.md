# Wallet routing

Portal exposes both configured account providers, Privy and Para, in the wallet
picker. The host selects one provider SDK at a time and opens its sign-in flow;
device authorization routes remain pinned to the requested provider. Choosing a
login provider does not grant delegation or select an Auto transaction account.
The explicit provider choice is remembered on this browser. Restore it before
mounting an SDK; a reload must neither open login again nor briefly exchange
credentials from a different default provider.

Settings uses the same host selector for linked embedded-wallet Connect and
Add method. A Para row opens Para even when Privy is mounted, and vice versa.
Without that host option, only the matching mounted provider may reconnect;
an unavailable provider fails explicitly instead of opening another provider.

Settings distinguishes linked account records from live signing capability.
`canSignFor(family, address)` supports provider-owned wallets that are not the
globally selected transaction account. Authorization and bind requests name the
exact signer. Para resolves that address to its SDK wallet ID, signs EIP-712 once
and checks EVM recovery, or signs Solana message bytes unchanged. Its Web SDK
returns Ed25519 signatures in base64. A mode stays pending until the existing
backend permit commit succeeds; no UI availability check replaces backend
linked-owner, exact-wallet, expiry, or version checks.

Auto-approve (`client_auto`) is caller-side behavior. It is not server Auto and
does not create delegation or enable an agent wallet.

Authorization (Manual/Auto), submission (Wallet/Hosted/Venue), and execution
(ordinary transaction/AA) are separate. A connected wallet is an identity and
capability, not a promise that it submits every transaction.

Settings selects the exact transaction account. Choosing Auto selects Hosted
before new preparation; an explicit Venue choice for that same account stays
Venue. Already-authorized agent accounts can be selected with **Use for this
session**. This selection is session-local: select it again after a reload.
Network/auth refreshes preserve it; an actual wallet switch or disconnect clears
the prior account's route. Para's login address is never replaced implicitly
with a Para agent address.

The shared `ClientSession` boundary refreshes AccountProfile and resolves the
selected account with `UserState.route`. Auto requires an active, unrevoked,
unexpired delegation for that exact address, chain, and provider. EVM address
comparison ignores case; SVM comparison does not. Missing Auto capability blocks
execution, not falls back to Manual. An uncertain start retries the same complete
intent and idempotency key.

`userState.evm.broadcaster` and `userState.svm.broadcaster` are optional values
`wallet | hosted | venue`, not authorization. Backend app policy bounds them.
Assembly freezes the resolved submitter; commit rejects Auto × Wallet and
unsupported adapters without changing authorizer, submitter, or payer.

## EVM routes available today

| Broadcaster × execution | Manual × UI                       | Manual × CLI                          | Auto × UI                 | Auto × CLI                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Wallet × no AA          | Wallet signs/submits              | Local key signs/submits               | Invalid; prepare Hosted   | Invalid; prepare Hosted   |
| Hosted × no AA          | Unsupported adapter               | Unsupported adapter                   | Provider signs/submits    | Provider signs/submits    |

| Hosted × AA             | Owner authorizes; backend submits | Owner key authorizes; backend submits | Server authorizes/submits | Server authorizes/submits |

SVM sealing is not AA. Supported no-AA adapters additionally allow Manual Hosted
(supported app-bound instructions) and Manual/Auto Venue (with the venue adapter).
Signed bytes return through the existing Action lifecycle, not Wallet submission.

## Client contract

- UI prompts only for Manual. Auto never returns a caller-signature prompt.
- CLI selects EVM with `--public-key` and SVM with `--solana-public-key`.
  Auto needs account authentication and delegation, not the selected wallet's
  private key. Manual requires a matching local key and supported adapter.
- CLI `--aa`/`--eoa` assert the prepared Action kind. They cannot change it;
  obsolete AA provider/mode overrides are rejected.
- Backend AA signatures use the supplied bytes exactly once. Funding is
  user-funded or sponsorship-required; application fees are separate from the
  maximum network cost. Ordinary backend transactions cannot acquire wallet-side
  AA or an injected paymaster at execution.
- Portable Pipeline V2 Builds retain origin, expiry, digest and attestation.
  Native action records are not a second wallet Action envelope.

Unit/component tests cover these boundaries. Real provider popups and funded
onchain execution are separate release gates, not implied by these tests.
