# Widget Frame

`@aomi-labs/widget-lib` is the prebuilt UI surface for embedding Aomi as a React chat widget.

## Composition

- `AomiFrame` is the main compound component exported by the registry package.
- `AomiFrame.Root` mounts `AomiRuntimeProvider`, sidebar state, notification UI, auth-to-runtime sync, and the runtime transaction handler.
- `AomiFrame.Header` renders the current thread title plus `ControlBar`.
- `AomiFrame.Composer` renders the active thread view and can expose inline controls.

## Layout Behavior

- The default layout shows the thread list sidebar unless `showSidebar={false}` is passed.
- Wallet controls can live in the sidebar header, sidebar footer, or be hidden entirely.
- `backendUrl` falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` and then `http://localhost:8080`.

## Supporting UI Surfaces

- Assistant UI primitives such as the thread list, message thread, and tool fallbacks live under `apps/registry/src/components/assistant-ui/`.
- The control surface lives under `apps/registry/src/components/control-bar/`.
- The registry package also exports themed CSS and individual component entrypoints for consumers that do not want the default frame layout.
