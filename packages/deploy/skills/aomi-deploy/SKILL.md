  your own stack against the typed client. The stable product is the client
  contract, not a UI component — build the UI your product needs.

# Integrate Aomi one-shot deploy

You are wiring **Aomi one-shot agent deploy** into a host app. Outcome: a user
clicks through a short flow and ends with a **live Aomi agent they can chat
with**. This is a thin, self-contained integration — you mount a few server
routes, point a browser client at them, and render a UI.

`@aomi-labs/deploy` is a typed relay to the Aomi platform. It does **not** run
agents or hold business logic; it drives the deploy lifecycle
(scaffold → deploy → CI build → activate → live) over the Aomi backend.

## The one rule: the server/browser boundary

Get this wrong and you leak a bearer token to the browser. Two of the four
entry points are **server-only**:

| Import | Runs | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@aomi-labs/deploy` | **server only** | `DeploymentClient` + the activation bearer |
| `@aomi-labs/deploy/bff` | **server only** | route factories that mint/inject the bearer |
| `@aomi-labs/deploy/launch` | browser | typed fetch client to your own BFF routes — no secrets |
| `@aomi-labs/deploy/lifecycle` | browser | pure helpers projecting deploy records into UI state |

The browser never talks to the Aomi backend directly. It talks to **your**
same-origin BFF routes; those hold the token. Never import `@aomi-labs/deploy`
or `/bff` from a client component.

## Prerequisites (get from Aomi)

- **Backend URL** for your platform, e.g. `https://api.aomi.dev`.
- **Activation token** for your platform (server-side secret). Aomi issues it;
  you never ship it to the browser.
- The **Aomi GitHub App** performs the repo scaffolding and deploy PRs. The
  OAuth client-id is baked into the auth routes; the client secret lives in the
  Aomi backend. You register nothing on GitHub.

## Install

```bash
npm install @aomi-labs/deploy      # or pnpm add / yarn add
```

## Step 1 — Mount the BFF routes (server)

Every handler is a plain `(Request) => Promise<Response>`. Build them once in a
server-only module and export the handlers:

```ts
// server/aomi-deploy.ts  (server-only)
import {
  createLaunchRoutes,
  createGitHubAuthRoutes,
  createGitHubSessionCodec,
} from "@aomi-labs/deploy/bff";
import { DeploymentClient } from "@aomi-labs/deploy";

const client = () =>
  new DeploymentClient({
    aomi: {
      backendUrl: process.env.AOMI_BACKEND_URL!,
      activationToken: process.env.AOMI_ACTIVATION_TOKEN!, // stays here
    },
  });

// Signs an HTTP-only session cookie for the signed-in GitHub user.
// `secret` is any >= 16-char string you hold; rotate like any app secret.
const session = createGitHubSessionCodec({ secret: process.env.AOMI_SESSION_SECRET! });

export const launch = createLaunchRoutes({
  client,
  session: (req) => session.fromRequest(req),
  // config: { platform: "your-platform", templateRepo: "you/agent-template" },
  // ^ or set APP_DEPLOY_PLATFORM / APP_DEPLOY_TEMPLATE_REPO env vars.
});

export const githubAuth = createGitHubAuthRoutes({
  client,
  session,
  callbackPath: "/api/bff/auth/github/callback",
  returnTo: "/deploy", // where the browser lands after sign-in
});
```

Mount them (Next.js App Router shown; any fetch server maps the same):

```ts
// app/api/bff/launch/deploy/route.ts      → export const POST = launch.deploy;
// app/api/bff/launch/preflight/route.ts   → export const POST = launch.preflight;
// app/api/bff/launch/create/route.ts      → export const POST = launch.create;
// app/api/bff/launch/activate/route.ts    → export const POST = launch.activate;
// app/api/bff/launch/redeploy/route.ts    → export const POST = launch.redeploy;
// app/api/bff/launch/status/route.ts      → export const GET  = launch.status;
// app/api/bff/launch/app/route.ts         → export const GET  = launch.app;
// app/api/bff/launch/sources/route.ts     → export const GET  = launch.sources;
// app/api/bff/auth/github/login/route.ts    → export const GET  = githubAuth.login;
// app/api/bff/auth/github/callback/route.ts → export const GET  = githubAuth.callback;
// app/api/bff/auth/github/status/route.ts   → export const GET  = githubAuth.status;
// app/api/bff/auth/github/signout/route.ts  → export const POST = githubAuth.signout;
```

**Swappable seams** (this is the flexibility — don't fork, inject):

- `session` — any `(req) => GitHubSession | null`. If you already have the
  signed-in GitHub user from your own auth, pass a function that returns it and
  skip `createGitHubAuthRoutes` entirely.
- `guards` — `{ read, write }` request guards. Defaults: per-IP rate limit +
  same-origin CSRF. Override for your infra (e.g. shared-store rate limiting).
- `config` — platform/template/target-tags. Defaults read `APP_DEPLOY_*` env.
- `githubToken` — optional; enables CI status enrichment + rerun
  (`process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN` by default).

## Step 2 — Wire the browser client

```ts
// client-side
import { createLaunchClient } from "@aomi-labs/deploy/launch";

const launch = createLaunchClient(); // defaults to /api/bff/launch + /api/bff/auth/github
// createLaunchClient({ basePath: "/api/deploy", authBasePath: "/api/gh" }) to relocate
```

`LaunchClient` is the entire browser surface. Methods (all typed):

```
fetchGitHubSession()         → { signedIn, githubLogin, installationId }
githubSigninUrl              → href for a "Sign in with GitHub" link
githubAppInstallUrl({app:2}) → URL to install the Aomi GitHub App
createRepo({installationId, repoName}) → scaffold from the template
preflight(input) / deploy(input)       → dry-run / apply
status({deploymentId})       → one poll: building | releasing | ready | failed
watch({deploymentId}, onEvent)         → poll to completion, backoff, never throws
activate({releaseTags, apps})→ promote the built release to live
appStatus({name, releaseTag})→ confirm the app is loaded & live
sources()                    → the signed-in user's deployed agents
platform / forPlatform(name) → the bound platform; a client scoped to another
deployments.*                → project console (sources, history, secrets, promote, …)
```

Targeting a named partner platform? Bind it once —
`createLaunchClient({ platform: "somm.finance" })` — rather than passing it on
every call; omitting it on one call silently falls back to the host default.

## Step 3 — Build the UI (in your stack)

There is **no UI component to install.** The deploy UI is a fast-churn page,
not a stable primitive — Aomi doesn't ship it as a package you vendor, because
a copied page rots the moment upstream changes and there's no upgrade path.
The stable thing is the `createLaunchClient` contract above; build the UI your
product actually needs on top of it, in whatever framework you use.

The **smallest useful flow** (the entire happy path) is:

1. `fetchGitHubSession()` → if not signed in, link to `githubSigninUrl`.
2. If `installationId` is null, send the user to `githubAppInstallUrl({app:2})`.
3. `createRepo({ installationId, repoName })` → get `appSourceId` + `sourceRef`.
4. `deploy({ appSourceId, sourceRef })` → get `deploymentId`.
5. Poll `status(deploymentId)` until `ready` (or `failed`).
6. `activate({ releaseTags, apps })` (both come off the deploy result / status).
7. `appStatus(...)` until live, then embed chat:
   `https://chat.aomi.dev?app=<name>&application_id=<id>&lock_app=1`.

Render it however the host brand wants — a single button, a stepper, a config
form, a conversational intake — because the contract underneath is just those
calls. A launchpad usually wants far less than a full dashboard: often just
"deploy" → status → chat, plus a stop control.

**Want a worked example to read (not vendor)?** Aomi's own portal builds this
exact flow in React against the same client — the deployment feature under
`apps/portal/src/features/launch/` in the `aomi-widget` repo (the one-shot
wizard plus a full operator console: deploy, promote, deactivate, env vars).
Read it for the wiring, then write your own; don't copy it in, or you inherit
Aomi's design stack (Tailwind, `@aomi-labs/react`, the aomi-theme tokens) and a
page you'll have to hand-reconcile on every upstream change.

## Verify it works

- Server routes return JSON, not HTML: `curl -s localhost:3000/api/bff/auth/github/status` → `{"signedIn":false,...}`.
- No secret in the browser bundle: grep your client build for the activation
  token — it must not appear. If it does, you imported `@aomi-labs/deploy` or
  `/bff` from a client component.
- End-to-end: sign in → install → create → deploy → the status poll reaches
  `ready` → activate → the chat embed loads the live agent.

## Constraints & honest gotchas

- **GitHub-identity today.** The current user path assumes the user signs in
  with GitHub and the agent's source repo is created in *their* GitHub account.
  Fine for a developer-facing portal; heavy for a consumer launchpad. If your
  users shouldn't touch GitHub, you want a **managed-source** deploy (Aomi owns
  the template, users only supply config) — that is a backend arrangement; ask
  Aomi rather than working around it client-side.
- **Immutable source ref.** `deploy` takes a git commit SHA, never a branch.
  `createRepo`/`preflight` resolve it for you; if you deploy by `appSourceId`
  directly, pass the SHA.
- **Secrets are write-only.** App env-vars/secrets, where supported, return
  key *names* only — values are never read back.
- **Errors.** BFF routes answer `{ error }` with a faithful HTTP status
  (`launchErrorResponse` maps `DeployError`/`BackendError`). Surface
  `json.error` to the user.
- **Not yet in the browser client:** operator lifecycle (deactivate/"stop",
  promote/rollback, deploy history) exists at the SDK layer but is not exposed
  through `createLaunchClient` yet. If you need a "stop my agent" button, add a
  BFF route over `DeploymentClient` and a client method — ask Aomi for the
  current shape.
