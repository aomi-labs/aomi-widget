// `@aomi-labs/account` — server-only BFF seam for every Aomi frontend (portal,
// base, landing). Resolve-or-create the canonical user against the database the
// Rust backend reads (BetterAuth session → `./account`'s
// `getOrCreateAomiUserForBetterAuthSession`), mint the AccountBearer that
// carries `sub` = that canonical id, and provide the shared session cookie +
// backend proxy + auth-exchange route every BFF mounts. Node-only (holds `pg` +
// the EdDSA private key) — never import into a browser/client bundle. See
// docs/topics/account-authentication/facts/service-identity.md.
