// @aomi-labs/service — the AOMI service topology: parse the service mesh and
// mint/verify AccountBearers as one node. The TS twin of the Rust `aomi-service`
// crate (one mesh, two vantages). Node-only — it holds EdDSA private keys; never
// bundle into a browser. See
// docs/topics/account-authentication/facts/service-identity.md.
